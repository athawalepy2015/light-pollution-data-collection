🌌 Light Pollution Data Extraction & Analysis | Python & Jupyter

Built a Python-based data extraction and analysis project using the Globe at Night (GaN) Light Pollution dataset. This project demonstrates foundational data science skills, including automated data collection from the web, structured data handling, and exploratory analysis within a Jupyter environment.

Using Python libraries such as requests, BeautifulSoup, and os, the project programmatically scrapes publicly available CSV datasets, stores them in an organized data pipeline, and prepares them for further analysis. The workflow highlights practical experience with data ingestion, scripting, and reproducible analytics.
